Genetic Algorithms and ant colony optimisation 
----------------------------------------------

This project in Maple uses global optimal computation functions such as Rosenbrock, Himmelblau and Rastrigin to simulate ant colony algorithms.

[Ant colony algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) are a technique of the optimization algorithms. This concept is also often put in parallel with [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). We synthesize the optimization of a path starting from a point A to a point B thanks to the natural path of the behavior of the ants. A first ant randomly takes a path leaving pheromones that give information about the path taken for other ants to come. Then other ants follow these paths while keeping a part of "exploration". Pheromones disappear over time in favor of the most used paths. The goal is to move towards an optimal path.
